            The Parish Church of St Cajetan of Thiene is a Roman Catholic parish church in Ħamrun, Malta, dedicated to Saint Cajetan. 
            The church was constructed between 1869 and 1875 to designs of Giorgio Costantino Schinas, in a combination of architectural styles. 
            The oratory and dome were added later on in the 1890s and 1950s; the latter was designed by Andrea Vassallo and it was constructed under 
            the direction of Ġużè Damato. <!-- Creating the Read More --> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

            As the settlement of Casale San Giuseppe (as Ħamrun was then known) began to grow in the 19th century, the two old churches dedicated to 
            Our Lady of Atocia (tas-Samra) and Our Lady of Porto Salvo (ta' Nuzzu) became too small to cater for the area. Therefore, the decision was taken to 
            construct a new church, and it was dedicated to Saint Cajetan according to the wishes of Bishop Gaetano Pace Forno, instead of Saint Joseph, to whom 
            there was popular devotion in the area.<br> <br>
            
            The foundation stone of the new church was laid down on 13 June 1869, on a plot of land donated by the Judge Giovanni Conti. Funds were raised by the 
            government, the population and some benefactors, and the building was designed by the architect Giorgio Costantino Schinas. The building was completed 
            in 1875, being inaugurated on 11 July of that year by Bishop Carmelo Scicluna. At the time of its construction, the area still formed part of the parish 
            of Qormi, but Ħamrun became a separate parish on 1 December 1881, with the Church of St. Cajetan becoming the parish church. The church was dedicated on 
            26 September 1930. <br> <br>

            The titular statue depicting Saint Cajetan was sculpted between 1885 and 1888 by Karlu Darmanin, with the pedestal being made by Giovanni Farrugia and the 
            detachable platform by Antonio Sciortino. The altarpiece depicts Saint Cajetan receiving the baby Jesus from Mary, and it was painted by the Italian artist 
            Pietro Gagliardi. Other works of art in the church include paintings by G. Briffa, Raphael Bonnici, Ramiro Calì, Emvin Cremona and other Maltese and Italian 
            artists.[3] The interior of the dome contains paintings by Emvin Cremona. Parts of the church's interior were altered following the Second Vatican Council, 
            with the main altar being replaced, and some side altars being replaced by confessionals. <br> <br>
            
            The centenary of the parish was celebrated in 1981 with the relics of Saint Cajetan being temporarily brought over to the church. Restoration works have been 
            undertaken on the dome interior, and on a number of paintings located in the church. Thirty solar panels were installed on the roof in 2012.
