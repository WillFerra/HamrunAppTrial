        <p>
            The story of the church of our Lady of Atocia dates back to the Great Siege of 1565 where several buildings were destroyed in Birgu, 
            leading to many deaths. Along with the houses that were destroyed, was the house of Toni Spinaci. In the house that was knocked down, 
            he had a baby girl named Elizabeth, who was sleeping in her cot, and was trapped with the rubble of the destroyed house. Her parents 
            thought she had died but, by some miracle, she was found alive. From this incident, God continued to protect her as He needed her to 
            spread adoration and devotion towards our Lady of Atocia.<!-- Creating the Read More --> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

            <br>
            <br>
            
            This devotion was brought to Malta by businessman Guzepppi Casauri who was married to Elizabeth Spinaci while he was on business in 
            Toledo who, inspired by the devotion he shared for the miraculous icon of Atocia, managed to obtain a copy of it from a friend of his. 
            When Casauri returned to Malta he built a church, with some rooms attached to it. This church was built on another church which was in 
            ruins and dedicated to St. Nicholas, on a hill previously known Braxia Hill. <br><br>

            From then on, this hill started being referred to as Atocia Hill, while the church is known as ‘tas-Samra’ due to the dark skin complexion of 
            Holy Mary’s face, which is identical to the one found in Madrid. Suddenly, several graces were granted thanks to the intercession of this miraculous icon, 
            and many were those who began to visit the church and pray in front the devoted icon. <br><br>

            In the beginning of the 20th Century, this church was abandoned and eventually was closed. It was opened only once a year for the feast of St. Mary while, 
            during the rest of the year, was reserved for storing of fodder, hay and straw. <br><br>

            The devotion for the feast of St. Mary on the 15th of August was started by St. Ġorġ Preca and continued by priest Ġorġ Bonello, a feast which is still 
            celebrated with great enthusiasm to this day. </span>
